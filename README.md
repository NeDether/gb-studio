## Note For Translators

If you'd like to help contribute new language localisations to GB Studio you can do so by submitting pull requests adding or updating the JSON files found here https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/tree/develop/src/lang

If you're looking to update an existing translation with content that is missing, there is a handy script that lists keys found in the English localisation that are not found and copies them to your localisation

```bash
npm run missing-translations lang
# e.g. npm run missing-translations de
# e.g. npm run missing-translations en-GB
```
