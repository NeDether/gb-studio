# GB Studio Storybook

Component library for UI of [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) with the following aims:

- Simplify the front end code.
- Improve keyboard accessibility.
- Separate Redux store from pure view components.
- Improve UI consistency.
- Improve UI documentation.

Components are built using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) with light mode and dark mode supplied as themes.

## UI

Components in the UI section come from `components/ui`. These components should follow these rules:

- Should have no access to Redux store.
- Should not hard code text or use localised content.
- Should not include any files outside of `components/ui`.
- Should localise use of styled-components to be within `style.ts` files.
- The `style.ts` files are not intended to be used outside of `components/ui` so you should provide wrapper components where needed.
- Don't expose [transient props](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#transient-props) in wrapper components.
  ```
  // e.g. wrapper <Label /> converts `gold` to the tranient prop `$gold`
  const Label = ({gold, children}) => <StyledLabel $gold={gold} children={children} />
  ```

## App

Components in App section can access the Redux store. Components will need to
be provided with a mock store containing the data and actions required.
